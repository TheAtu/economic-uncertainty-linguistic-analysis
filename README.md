# economic-uncertainty-linguistic-analysis
 This repository houses the Python code and research materials for an in-depth analysis of linguistic patterns during periods of economic uncertainty. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and economic tools, the study examines language use in newspapers, government communications, and public discourse between 2018 and 2022 in Argentina. The goal is to uncover correlations between linguistic styles and economic indicators, providing insights into the relationship between language and economic uncertainty.

# Economic Uncertainty Linguistic Analysis

This project delves into the intersection of linguistics, economics, and data science to explore how language evolves during periods of economic uncertainty. By analyzing linguistic patterns in three groups: newspapers/news channels, government communications, and public discourse from reddit. We aim to uncover valuable insights into the relationship between language and economic conditions.
