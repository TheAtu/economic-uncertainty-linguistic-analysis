# economic-uncertainty-linguistic-analysis
 This repository houses the Python code and research materials for an in-depth analysis of linguistic patterns during periods of economic uncertainty. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and economic tools, the study examines language use in newspapers, government communications, and public discourse between 2018 and 2022 in Argentina. The goal is to uncover correlations between linguistic styles and economic indicators, providing insights into the relationship between language and economic uncertainty.
